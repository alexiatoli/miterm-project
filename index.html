            <h2>Introduction to Deepfake Technology</h2>
            <p>Deepfake technology refers to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, to manipulate audio, video, and images, creating realistic but entirely fake content. As AI algorithms advance, the ability to create realistic deepfakes has become more accessible, contributing to its rise in popularity.</p>
            <p>While deepfakes can have legitimate uses in entertainment, education, and other fields, they also present significant challenges. The growing concern is their potential misuse in spreading misinformation, damaging reputations, and even impacting elections. The rapid evolution of deepfake technology raises important ethical questions surrounding privacy invasion, trust, and the potential harm they can cause to individuals and society.</p>
            <p>As deepfake technology advances, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and explore ways to detect and regulate its misuse to mitigate the risks posed by this powerful tool.</p>
