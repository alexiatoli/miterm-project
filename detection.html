            <h2>Methods for Detecting Deepfakes</h2>
            <p>Deepfake detection involves various methods to identify manipulated content. Here we explore AI-based techniques like convolutional neural networks and forensic analysis methods, including metadata analysis and pixel-level scrutiny. Real-world tools like Microsoft's Video Authenticator and Deepware Scanner help automate detection.</p>
